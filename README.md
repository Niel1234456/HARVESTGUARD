🛠️ MAIN FUNCTIONS
1️⃣ CROP & DISEASE MONITORING

Purpose: Detect plant diseases early to prevent crop loss
How it works:

Farmers upload or capture crop images.

ML model (Python/Flask API) analyzes images.

Returns:

Disease name

Effects on crops

Recommended solutions

Impact: Prevents crop damage and enables timely interventions.

2️⃣ DESCRIPTIVE ANALYTICS

Purpose: Provides actionable insights from data
How it works:

Collects crop yield, inventory, and request data.

Generates charts & summaries using analytics engine.

Dashboard displays trends for farmers and administrators.

Impact: Supports data-driven decision-making.

3️⃣ INVENTORY MANAGEMENT

Purpose: Track supplies and equipment in real-time
How it works:

Updates stock automatically for borrowed/used/returned items.

Alerts administrators when stock is low.

Impact: Prevents shortages and ensures availability.

4️⃣ EQUIPMENT BORROWING SYSTEM

Purpose: Request and borrow agricultural equipment
How it works:

Farmers submit requests with quantity and return date.

Backend tracks approval and history.

Impact: Streamlines equipment allocation and accountability.

5️⃣ REPORT GENERATION

Purpose: Generate formal reports
How it works:

Convert crop monitoring and inventory data to PDF

Reports include crop status, disease detection, borrowed equipment

Impact: Simplifies documentation and improves transparency.

6️⃣ NOTIFICATIONS & STATUS UPDATES

Purpose: Keep users informed in real-time
How it works:

Sends notifications for requests, inventory updates, and disease results.

Impact: Improves communication and reduces delays.
